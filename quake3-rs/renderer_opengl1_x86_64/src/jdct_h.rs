 * An inverse DCT routine is given a pointer to the input JBLOCK and a pointer

 * well as perform the IDCT; for dequantization, it uses the multiplier table
 * pointed to by compptr->dct_table.  The output data is to be placed into the
 * sample array starting at a specified column.  (Any row offset needed will
 * be applied to the array pointer before it is passed to the IDCT code.)
