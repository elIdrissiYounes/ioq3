      Process a set of code lengths to create a canonical Huffman code.  The
      code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the
      symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the
      symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order
      for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits
      for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer
      increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length
      increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards
      from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the
      decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes
      are incremented backwards.

      This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in
      lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.
      1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that
      symbol does not occur in this code.

      The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,
      creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the
      sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted
      table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by
      the caller.

      The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding
      the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any
      codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead
      at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the
      decoding tables.

      Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being
      filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff
      with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop
      bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,
      those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to
      fill the table with replicated entries.

      root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds
      root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index
      of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a
      new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is
      being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.

      When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the
      code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length
      counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are
      entered in the tables.

      used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the
      provided *table space.  It is checked when a LENS table is being made
      against the space in *table, ENOUGH, minus the maximum space needed by
      the worst case distance code, MAXD.  This should never happen, but the
      sufficiency of ENOUGH has not been proven exhaustively, hence the check.
      This assumes that when type == LENS, bits == 9.

      sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when
      all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This
      routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills
      in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.
