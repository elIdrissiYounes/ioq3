/*A range decoder.
This is an entropy decoder based upon \cite{Mar79}, which is itself a
 rediscovery of the FIFO arithmetic code introduced by \cite{Pas76}.
It is very similar to arithmetic encoding, except that encoding is done with
 digits in any base, instead of with bits, and so it is faster when using
 larger bases (i.e.: a byte).
The author claims an average waste of $\frac{1}{2}\log_b(2b)$ bits, where $b$
 is the base, longer than the theoretical optimum, but to my knowledge there
 is no published justification for this claim.
This only seems true when using near-infinite precision arithmetic so that
 the process is carried out with no rounding errors.

An excellent description of implementation details is available at
 http://www.arturocampos.com/ac_range.html
A recent work \cite{MNW98} which proposes several changes to arithmetic
 encoding for efficiency actually re-discovers many of the principles
 behind range encoding, and presents a good theoretical analysis of them.

End of stream is handled by writing out the smallest number of bits that
 ensures that the stream will be correctly decoded regardless of the value of
 any subsequent bits.
ec_tell() can be used to determine how many bits were needed to decode
 all the symbols thus far; other data can be packed in the remaining bits of
 the input buffer.
