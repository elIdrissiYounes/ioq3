                                                          compliant machines had a bug that
                                                          returned dB values about a third
                                                          of a decibel too high.  The bug
                                                          was harmless because tunings
                                                          implicitly took that into
                                                          account.  However, fixing the bug
                                                          in the estimator requires
                                                          changing all the tunings as well.
                                                          For now, it's easier to sync
                                                          things back up here, and
                                                          recalibrate the tunings in the
                                                          next major model upgrade. */
