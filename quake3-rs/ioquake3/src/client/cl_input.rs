KEY BUTTONS

Continuous button event tracking is complicated by the fact that two different
input sources (say, mouse button 1 and the control key) can both press the
same button, but the button should only be released when both of the
pressing key have been released.

When a key event issues a button command (+forward, +attack, etc), it appends
its key number as argv(1) so it can be matched up with the release.

argv(2) will be set to the time the event happened, which allows exact
control even at low framerates when the down and up events may both get qued
at the same time.
