     VM Considerations

     The VM can not use the standard system headers because we aren't really
     using the compiler they were meant for.  We use bg_lib.h which contains
     prototypes for the functions we define for our own use in bg_lib.c.

     When writing mods, please add needed headers HERE, do not start including
     stuff like <stdio.h> in the various .c files that make up each of the VMs
     since you will be including system headers files can will have issues.

     Remember, if you use a C library function that is not defined in bg_lib.c,
     you will have to add your own version for support in the VM.

G_Damage

targ		entity that is being damaged
inflictor	entity that is causing the damage
attacker	entity that caused the inflictor to damage targ
    example: targ=monster, inflictor=rocket, attacker=player

dir			direction of the attack for knockback
point		point at which the damage is being inflicted, used for headshots
damage		amount of damage being inflicted
knockback	force to be applied against targ as a result of the damage

inflictor, attacker, dir, and point can be NULL for environmental effects

dflags		these flags are used to control how T_Damage works
    DAMAGE_RADIUS			damage was indirect (from a nearby explosion)
    DAMAGE_NO_ARMOR			armor does not protect from this damage
    DAMAGE_NO_KNOCKBACK		do not affect velocity, just view angles
    DAMAGE_NO_PROTECTION	kills godmode, armor, everything
