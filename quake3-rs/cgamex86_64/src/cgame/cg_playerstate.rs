// player entities need to track more information
// than any other type of entity.
// note that not every player entity is a client entity,
// because corpses after respawn are outside the normal
// client numbering range
// when changing animation, set animationTime to frameTime + lerping time
// The current lerp will finish out, then it will lerp to the new animation
// time when ->oldFrame was exactly on
// time when ->frame will be exactly on
// may include ANIM_TOGGLEBIT
// time when the first frame of the animation will be exact
// flip from 0 to 1

// so it will rotate centered instead of by tag
// fast firing weapons randomly choose
// each IT_* item has an associated itemInfo_t
// that constains media references necessary to present the
// item and its effects
//======================================================================

// occurs, and they will have visible effects for #define STEP_TIME or whatever msec after
