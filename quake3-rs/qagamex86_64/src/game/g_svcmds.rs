PACKET FILTERING


You can add or remove addresses from the filter list with:

addip <ip>
removeip <ip>

The ip address is specified in dot format, and you can use '*' to match any value
so you can specify an entire class C network with "addip 192.246.40.*"

Removeip will only remove an address specified exactly the same way.  You cannot addip a subnet, then removeip a single host.

listip
Prints the current list of filters.

g_filterban <0 or 1>

If 1 (the default), then ip addresses matching the current list will be prohibited from entering the game.  This is the default setting.

If 0, then only addresses matching the list will be allowed.  This lets you easily set up a private game, or a game that only allows players from your local network.

TTimo NOTE: for persistence, bans are stored in g_banIPs cvar MAX_CVAR_VALUE_STRING
The size of the cvar string buffer is limiting the banning to around 20 masks
this could be improved by putting some g_banIPs2 g_banIps3 etc. maybe
still, you should rely on PB for banning instead
