Arnout: this is a nasty issue. Shaders can be registered after drawsurfaces are generated
but before the frame is rendered. This will, for the duration of one frame, cause drawsurfaces
to be rendered with bad shaders. To fix this, need to go through all render commands and fix
sortedIndex.

In the interest of not requiring an explicit shader text entry to
be defined for every single image used in the game, three default
shader behaviors can be auto-created for any image:

If lightmapIndex == LIGHTMAP_NONE, then the image will have
dynamic diffuse lighting applied to it, as appropriate for most
entity skin surfaces.

If lightmapIndex == LIGHTMAP_2D, then the image will be used
for 2D rendering unless an explicit shader is found

If lightmapIndex == LIGHTMAP_BY_VERTEX, then the image will use
the vertex rgba modulate values, as appropriate for misc_model
pre-lit surfaces.

Other lightmapIndex values will have a lightmap stage created
and src*dest blending applied with the texture, as appropriate for
most world construction surfaces.
