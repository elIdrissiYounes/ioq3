/*
  Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
  literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
  available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
  When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
  example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
  inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

  Entry assumptions:

       state->mode == LEN
       strm->avail_in >= 6
       strm->avail_out >= 258
       start >= strm->avail_out
       state->bits < 8

  On return, state->mode is one of:

       LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
       TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
       BAD -- error in block data

  Notes:

   - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
     length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
     and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
     Therefore if strm->avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
     checking for available input while decoding.

   - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
     bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
     requires strm->avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
     output space.

  inflate_fast() speedups that turned out slower (on a PowerPC G3 750CXe):
  - Using bit fields for code structure
  - Different op definition to avoid & for extra bits (do & for table bits)
  - Three separate decoding do-loops for direct, window, and write == 0
  - Special case for distance > 1 copies to do overlapped load and store copy
  - Explicit branch predictions (based on measured branch probabilities)
  - Deferring match copy and interspersed it with decoding subsequent codes
  - Swapping literal/length else
  - Swapping window/direct else
  - Larger unrolled copy loops (three is about right)
  - Moving len -= 3 statement into middle of loop
