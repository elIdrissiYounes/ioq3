 */
/*
 * Change history:
 *
 * 1.2.beta0    24 Nov 2002
 * - First version -- complete rewrite of inflate to simplify code, avoid
 *   creation of window when not needed, minimize use of window when it is
 *   needed, make inffast.c even faster, implement gzip decoding, and to
 *   improve code readability and style over the previous zlib inflate code
 *
 * 1.2.beta1    25 Nov 2002
 * - Use pointers for available input and output checking in inffast.c
 * - Remove input and output counters in inffast.c
 * - Change inffast.c entry and loop from avail_in >= 7 to >= 6
 * - Remove unnecessary second byte pull from length extra in inffast.c
 * - Unroll direct copy to three copies per loop in inffast.c
 *
 * 1.2.beta2    4 Dec 2002
 * - Change external routine names to reduce potential conflicts
 * - Correct filename to inffixed.h for fixed tables in inflate.c
 * - Make hbuf[] unsigned char to match parameter type in inflate.c
 * - Change strm->next_out[-state->offset] to *(strm->next_out - state->offset)
 *   to avoid negation problem on Alphas (64 bit) in inflate.c
 *
 * 1.2.beta3    22 Dec 2002
 * - Add comments on state->bits assertion in inffast.c
 * - Add comments on op field in inftrees.h
 * - Fix bug in reuse of allocated window after inflateReset()
 * - Remove bit fields--back to byte structure for speed
 * - Remove distance extra == 0 check in inflate_fast()--only helps for lengths
 * - Change post-increments to pre-increments in inflate_fast(), PPC biased?
 * - Add compile time option, POSTINC, to use post-increments instead (Intel?)
 * - Make MATCH copy in inflate() much faster for when inflate_fast() not used
 * - Use local copies of stream next and avail values, as well as local bit
 *   buffer and bit count in inflate()--for speed when inflate_fast() not used
 *
 * 1.2.beta4    1 Jan 2003
 * - Split ptr - 257 statements in inflate_table() to avoid compiler warnings
 * - Move a comment on output buffer sizes from inffast.c to inflate.c
 * - Add comments in inffast.c to introduce the inflate_fast() routine
 * - Rearrange window copies in inflate_fast() for speed and simplification
 * - Unroll last copy for window match in inflate_fast()
 * - Use local copies of window variables in inflate_fast() for speed
 * - Pull out common write == 0 case for speed in inflate_fast()
 * - Make op and len in inflate_fast() unsigned for consistency
 * - Add FAR to lcode and dcode declarations in inflate_fast()
 * - Simplified bad distance check in inflate_fast()
 * - Added inflateBackInit(), inflateBack(), and inflateBackEnd() in new
 *   source file infback.c to provide a call-back interface to inflate for
 *   programs like gzip and unzip -- uses window as output buffer to avoid
 *   window copying
 *
 * 1.2.beta5    1 Jan 2003
 * - Improved inflateBack() interface to allow the caller to provide initial
 *   input in strm.
 * - Fixed stored blocks bug in inflateBack()
 *
 * 1.2.beta6    4 Jan 2003
 * - Added comments in inffast.c on effectiveness of POSTINC
 * - Typecasting all around to reduce compiler warnings
 * - Changed loops from while (1) or do {} while (1) to for (;;), again to
 *   make compilers happy
 * - Changed type of window in inflateBackInit() to unsigned char *
 *
 * 1.2.beta7    27 Jan 2003
 * - Changed many types to unsigned or unsigned short to avoid warnings
 * - Added inflateCopy() function
 *
 * 1.2.0        9 Mar 2003
 * - Changed inflateBack() interface to provide separate opaque descriptors
 *   for the in() and out() functions
 * - Changed inflateBack() argument and in_func typedef to swap the length
 *   and buffer address return values for the input function
 * - Check next_in and next_out for Z_NULL on entry to inflate()
 *
 * The history for versions after 1.2.0 are in ChangeLog in zlib distribution.

  Return state with length and distance decoding tables and index sizes set to
  fixed code decoding.  Normally this returns fixed tables from inffixed.h.
  If BUILDFIXED is defined, then instead this routine builds the tables the
  first time it's called, and returns those tables the first time and
  thereafter.  This reduces the size of the code by about 2K bytes, in
  exchange for a little execution time.  However, BUILDFIXED should not be
  used for threaded applications, since the rewriting of the tables and virgin

  Update the window with the last wsize (normally 32K) bytes written before
  returning.  If window does not exist yet, create it.  This is only called
  when a window is already in use, or when output has been written during this
  inflate call, but the end of the deflate stream has not been reached yet.
  It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary
  is loaded.

  Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
  advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window
  upon return from inflate(), and since all distances after the first 32K of
  output will fall in the output data, making match copies simpler and faster.
  The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor's data caches.

  inflate() uses a state machine to process as much input data and generate as
  much output data as possible before returning.  The state machine is
  structured roughly as follows:

   for (;;) switch (state) {
   ...
   case STATEn:
       if (not enough input data or output space to make progress)
           return;
       ... make progress ...
       state = STATEm;
       break;
   ...
   }

  so when inflate() is called again, the same case is attempted again, and
  if the appropriate resources are provided, the machine proceeds to the
  next state.  The NEEDBITS() macro is usually the way the state evaluates
  whether it can proceed or should return.  NEEDBITS() does the return if
  the requested bits are not available.  The typical use of the BITS macros
  is:

       NEEDBITS(n);
       ... do something with BITS(n) ...
       DROPBITS(n);

  where NEEDBITS(n) either returns from inflate() if there isn't enough
  input left to load n bits into the accumulator, or it continues.  BITS(n)
  gives the low n bits in the accumulator.  When done, DROPBITS(n) drops
  the low n bits off the accumulator.  INITBITS() clears the accumulator
  and sets the number of available bits to zero.  BYTEBITS() discards just
  enough bits to put the accumulator on a byte boundary.  After BYTEBITS()
  and a NEEDBITS(8), then BITS(8) would return the next byte in the stream.

  NEEDBITS(n) uses PULLBYTE() to get an available byte of input, or to return
  if there is no input available.  The decoding of variable length codes uses
  PULLBYTE() directly in order to pull just enough bytes to decode the next
  code, and no more.

  Some states loop until they get enough input, making sure that enough
  state information is maintained to continue the loop where it left off
  if NEEDBITS() returns in the loop.  For example, want, need, and keep
  would all have to actually be part of the saved state in case NEEDBITS()
  returns:

   case STATEw:
       while (want < need) {
           NEEDBITS(n);
           keep[want++] = BITS(n);
           DROPBITS(n);
       }
       state = STATEx;
   case STATEx:

  As shown above, if the next state is also the next case, then the break
  is omitted.

  A state may also return if there is not enough output space available to
  complete that state.  Those states are copying stored data, writing a
  literal byte, and copying a matching string.

  When returning, a "goto inf_leave" is used to update the total counters,
  update the check value, and determine whether any progress has been made
  during that inflate() call in order to return the proper return code.
  Progress is defined as a change in either strm->avail_in or strm->avail_out.
  When there is a window, goto inf_leave will update the window with the last
  output written.  If a goto inf_leave occurs in the middle of decompression
  and there is no window currently, goto inf_leave will create one and copy
  output to the window for the next call of inflate().

  In this implementation, the flush parameter of inflate() only affects the
  return code (per zlib.h).  inflate() always writes as much as possible to
  strm->next_out, given the space available and the provided input--the effect
  documented in zlib.h of Z_SYNC_FLUSH.  Furthermore, inflate() always defers
  the allocation of and copying into a sliding window until necessary, which
  provides the effect documented in zlib.h for Z_FINISH when the entire input
  stream available.  So the only thing the flush parameter actually does is:
  when flush is set to Z_FINISH, inflate() cannot return Z_OK.  Instead it
  will return Z_BUF_ERROR if it has not reached the end of the stream.

/*
      inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK can be used to
   force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is complete
   and before any actual data is decompressed.

      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.)  If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When
   any of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is
   not present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

      If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

      inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized
   before the call.  If zalloc and zfree are Z_NULL, then the default library-
   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the paramaters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not
   be allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not

     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than inflate() for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free
   the allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned
   an error.  If strm->next is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to
   out() returning non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so
   strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note
   that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.

     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output. This function must be called
   immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, before any
   call of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in
   deflate or deflate2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In addition, the
   current implementation of deflate will use at most the window size minus
   262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is
   a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a null strm). msg
   is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform
   any decompression apart from reading the zlib header if present: this will
   be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out
   and avail_out are unchanged.)

  description of deflate with Z_FULL_FLUSH) can be found, or until all
  available input is skipped. No output is provided.

    inflateSync returns Z_OK if a full flush point has been found, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no flush point has been found,
  or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent. In the success
  case, the application may save the current current value of total_in which
  indicates where valid compressed data was found. In the error case, the
  application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more input each time,
  until success or end of the input data.
