ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits));

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is
   a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a null strm). msg
   is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform
   any decompression apart from reading the zlib header if present: this will
   be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out
   and avail_out are unchanged.)

      inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the

   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK can be used to
   force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is complete
   and before any actual data is decompressed.

      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.)  If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When
   any of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is
   not present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

      If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

      inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateBackInit OF((z_streamp strm, int windowBits,

     Initialize the internal stream state for decompression using inflateBack()
   calls.  The fields zalloc, zfree and opaque in strm must be initialized

   derived memory allocation routines are used.  windowBits is the base two
   logarithm of the window size, in the range 8..15.  window is a caller
   supplied buffer of that size.  Except for special applications where it is
   assured that deflate was used with small window sizes, windowBits must be 15
   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     See inflateBack() for the usage of these routines.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of
   the paramaters are invalid, Z_MEM_ERROR if the internal state could not
   be allocated, or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the version of the library does not
   match the version of the header file.
*/
/*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than inflate() for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free
   the allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 .. strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned
   an error.  If strm->next is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to
   out() returning non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so
   strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note
   that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.

     All memory allocated by inflateBackInit() is freed.

     inflateBackEnd() returns Z_OK on success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream

   Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the compressed buffer.

   input file is mmap'ed.

     uncompress returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output
   buffer, or Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted or incomplete.

/*
  Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing. The mode parameter
is as in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level
("wb9") or a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for
Huffman only compression as in "wb1h", or 'R' for run-length encoding
as in "wb1R". (See the description of deflateInit2 for more information
about the strategy parameter.)

  gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

  gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state; errno
can be checked to distinguish the two cases (if errno is zero, the
zlib error is Z_MEM_ERROR).  */
/*
     gzdopen() associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File
   descriptors are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or
   fileno (in the file has been previously opened with fopen).
   The mode parameter is as in gzopen.
     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the
   file descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd), mode) closes the file
   descriptor fd. If you want to keep fd open, use gzdopen(dup(fd), mode).
     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate
   the (de)compression state.

   this limit is not exceeded. If it is exceeded, then gzprintf() will return
   return an error (0) with nothing written. In this case, there may also be a
   buffer overflow with unpredictable consequences, which is possible only if
   zlib was compiled with the insecure functions sprintf() or vsprintf()
   because the secure snprintf() or vsnprintf() functions were not available.

   character will be discarded if the stream is repositioned with gzseek()
   or gzrewind().

/*
     Flushes all pending output into the compressed file. The parameter
   flush is as in the deflate() function. The return value is the zlib
   error number (see function gzerror below). gzflush returns Z_OK if

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

      gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from

/*
     Returns the error message for the last error which occurred on the
   given compressed file. errnum is set to zlib error number. If an
   error occurred in the file system and not in the compression library,

   An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed
   much faster. Usage example:
