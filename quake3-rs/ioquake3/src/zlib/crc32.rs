     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output. This function must be called
   immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, before any
   call of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same
   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in
   deflate or deflate2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be
   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front. In addition, the
   current implementation of deflate will use at most the window size minus
   262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the adler32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The adler32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   adler32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used. If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate. In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size. inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream. This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values. If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an adler32 or a crc32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is. Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding. Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is
   a crc32 instead of an adler32.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a null strm). msg
   is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform
   any decompression apart from reading the zlib header if present: this will
   be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but next_out
   and avail_out are unchanged.)

   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is

   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK can be used to
   force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is complete
   and before any actual data is decompressed.

      The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.)  If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,

   and a 32K byte window must be supplied to be able to decompress general
   deflate streams.

     inflateBackInit will return Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any of

/*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is more efficient than inflate() for
   file i/o applications in that it avoids copying between the output and the
   sliding window by simply making the window itself the output buffer.  This
   function trusts the application to not change the output buffer passed by
   the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free
   the allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects
   only the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the
   normal behavior of inflate(), which expects either a zlib or gzip header and
   trailer around the deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero--buf is ignored in that
   case--and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will call
   out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0..len-1].  out()
   should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out() returns
   non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor out()
   are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format
   error in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the
   nature of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly
   initialized.  In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be
   distinguished using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned
   an error.  If strm->next is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to
   out() returning non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so
   strm->next_in is assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note
   that inflateBack() cannot return Z_OK.
