\section Introduction

This is the documentation for the <tt>libopusfile</tt> C API.

The <tt>libopusfile</tt> package provides a convenient high-level API for
 decoding and basic manipulation of all Ogg Opus audio streams.
<tt>libopusfile</tt> is implemented as a layer on top of Xiph.Org's
 reference
 <tt><a href="https://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/reference.html">libogg</a></tt>
 and
 <tt><a href="https://mf4.xiph.org/jenkins/view/opus/job/opus/ws/doc/html/index.html">libopus</a></tt>
 libraries.

<tt>libopusfile</tt> provides several sets of built-in routines for
 file/stream access, and may also use custom stream I/O routines provided by
 the embedded environment.
There are built-in I/O routines provided for ANSI-compliant
 <code>stdio</code> (<code>FILE *</code>), memory buffers, and URLs
 (including <file:> URLs, plus optionally <http:> and <https:> URLs).

\section Organization

The main API is divided into several sections:
- \ref stream_open_close
- \ref stream_info
- \ref stream_decoding
- \ref stream_seeking

Several additional sections are not tied to the main API.
- \ref stream_callbacks
- \ref header_info
- \ref error_codes

\section Overview

The <tt>libopusfile</tt> API always decodes files to 48&nbsp;kHz.
The original sample rate is not preserved by the lossy compression, though
 it is stored in the header to allow you to resample to it after decoding
 (the <tt>libopusfile</tt> API does not currently provide a resampler,
 but the
 <a href="http://www.speex.org/docs/manual/speex-manual/node7.html#SECTION00760000000000000000">the
 Speex resampler</a> is a good choice if you need one).
In general, if you are playing back the audio, you should leave it at
 48&nbsp;kHz, provided your audio hardware supports it.
When decoding to a file, it may be worth resampling back to the original
 sample rate, so as not to surprise users who might not expect the sample
 rate to change after encoding to Opus and decoding.

Opus files can contain anywhere from 1 to 255 channels of audio.
The channel mappings for up to 8 channels are the same as the
 <a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html#x1-800004.3.9">Vorbis
 mappings</a>.
A special stereo API can convert everything to 2 channels, making it simple
 to support multichannel files in an application which only has stereo
 output.
Although the <tt>libopusfile</tt> ABI provides support for the theoretical
 maximum number of channels, the current implementation does not support
 files with more than 8 channels, as they do not have well-defined channel
 mappings.

Like all Ogg files, Opus files may be "chained".
That is, multiple Opus files may be combined into a single, longer file just
 by concatenating the original files.
This is commonly done in internet radio streaming, as it allows the title
 and artist to be updated each time the song changes, since each link in the
 chain includes its own set of metadata.

<tt>libopusfile</tt> fully supports chained files.
It will decode the first Opus stream found in each link of a chained file
 (ignoring any other streams that might be concurrently multiplexed with it,
 such as a video stream).

The channel count can also change between links.
If your application is not prepared to deal with this, it can use the stereo
 API to ensure the audio from all links will always get decoded into a
 common format.
Since <tt>libopusfile</tt> always decodes to 48&nbsp;kHz, you do not have to
 worry about the sample rate changing between links (as was possible with
 Vorbis).
This makes application support for chained files with <tt>libopusfile</tt>
 very easy.*/

/* *\name List of possible error codes
Many of the functions in this library return a negative error code when a
 function fails.
This list provides a brief explanation of the common errors.
See each individual function for more details on what a specific error code
 means in that context.*/
/*@{*/
/* *A request did not succeed.*/
/*Currently not used externally.*/
/* *There was a hole in the page sequence numbers (e.g., a page was corrupt or
missing).*/
/* *An underlying read, seek, or tell operation failed when it should have
succeeded.*/
/* *A <code>NULL</code> pointer was passed where one was unexpected, or an
internal memory allocation failed, or an internal library error was
encountered.*/
/* *The stream used a feature that is not implemented, such as an unsupported
channel family.*/
/* *One or more parameters to a function were invalid.*/
/* *A purported Ogg Opus stream did not begin with an Ogg page, a purported
header packet did not start with one of the required strings, "OpusHead" or
"OpusTags", or a link in a chained file was encountered that did not
contain any logical Opus streams.*/
/* *A required header packet was not properly formatted, contained illegal
values, or was missing altogether.*/
/* *The ID header contained an unrecognized version number.*/
/*Currently not used at all.*/
/* *An audio packet failed to decode properly.
This is usually caused by a multistream Ogg packet where the durations of
 the individual Opus packets contained in it are not all the same.*/
/* *We failed to find data we had seen before, or the bitstream structure was
sufficiently malformed that seeking to the target destination was
impossible.*/
/* *An operation that requires seeking was requested on an unseekable stream.*/
/* *The first or last granule position of a link failed basic validity checks.*/
/*@}*/
/*@}*/
/* *\defgroup header_info Header Information*/
/*@{*/
/* *The maximum number of channels in an Ogg Opus stream.*/
/* *Ogg Opus bitstream information.
This contains the basic playback parameters for a stream, and corresponds to
 the initial ID header packet of an Ogg Opus stream.*/
/* *The Ogg Opus format version, in the range 0...255.
The top 4 bits represent a "major" version, and the bottom four bits
 represent backwards-compatible "minor" revisions.
The current specification describes version 1.
This library will recognize versions up through 15 as backwards compatible
 with the current specification.
An earlier draft of the specification described a version 0, but the only
 difference between version 1 and version 0 is that version 0 did
 not specify the semantics for handling the version field.*/
/* *The number of channels, in the range 1...255.*/
/* *The number of samples that should be discarded from the beginning of the
stream.*/
/* *The sampling rate of the original input.
All Opus audio is coded at 48 kHz, and should also be decoded at 48 kHz
 for playback (unless the target hardware does not support this sampling
 rate).
However, this field may be used to resample the audio back to the original
 sampling rate, for example, when saving the output to a file.*/
/* *The gain to apply to the decoded output, in dB, as a Q8 value in the range
 -32768...32767.
The <tt>libopusfile</tt> API will automatically apply this gain to the
 decoded output before returning it, scaling it by
 <code>pow(10,output_gain/(20.0*256))</code>.
You can adjust this behavior with op_set_gain_offset().*/
/* *The channel mapping family, in the range 0...255.
Channel mapping family 0 covers mono or stereo in a single stream.
Channel mapping family 1 covers 1 to 8 channels in one or more streams,
 using the Vorbis speaker assignments.
Channel mapping family 255 covers 1 to 255 channels in one or more
 streams, but without any defined speaker assignment.*/
/* *The number of Opus streams in each Ogg packet, in the range 1...255.*/
/* *The number of coupled Opus streams in each Ogg packet, in the range
 0...127.
This must satisfy <code>0 <= coupled_count <= stream_count</code> and
 <code>coupled_count + stream_count <= 255</code>.
The coupled streams appear first, before all uncoupled streams, in an Ogg
 Opus packet.*/
/* *The mapping from coded stream channels to output channels.
Let <code>index=mapping[k]</code> be the value for channel <code>k</code>.
If <code>index<2*coupled_count</code>, then it refers to the left channel
 from stream <code>(index/2)</code> if even, and the right channel from
 stream <code>(index/2)</code> if odd.
Otherwise, it refers to the output of the uncoupled stream
 <code>(index-coupled_count)</code>.*/
/* *The metadata from an Ogg Opus stream.

This structure holds the in-stream metadata corresponding to the 'comment'
 header packet of an Ogg Opus stream.
The comment header is meant to be used much like someone jotting a quick
 note on the label of a CD.
It should be a short, to the point text note that can be more than a couple
 words, but not more than a short paragraph.

The metadata is stored as a series of (tag, value) pairs, in length-encoded
 string vectors, using the same format as Vorbis (without the final "framing
 bit"), Theora, and Speex, except for the packet header.
The first occurrence of the '=' character delimits the tag and value.
A particular tag may occur more than once, and order is significant.
The character set encoding for the strings is always UTF-8, but the tag
 names are limited to ASCII, and treated as case-insensitive.
See <a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html">the Vorbis
 comment header specification</a> for details.

In filling in this structure, <tt>libopusfile</tt> will null-terminate the
 #user_comments strings for safety.
However, the bitstream format itself treats them as 8-bit clean vectors,
 possibly containing NUL characters, so the #comment_lengths array should be
 treated as their authoritative length.

This structure is binary and source-compatible with a
 <code>vorbis_comment</code>, and pointers to it may be freely cast to
 <code>vorbis_comment</code> pointers, and vice versa.
It is provided as a separate type to avoid introducing a compile-time
 dependency on the libvorbis headers.*/
/* *The array of comment string vectors.*/
/* *An array of the corresponding length of each vector, in bytes.*/
/* *The total number of comment streams.*/
/* *The null-terminated vendor string.
This identifies the software used to encode the stream.*/
/* *\name Picture tag image formats*/
/*@{*/
/* *The MIME type was not recognized, or the image data did not match the
declared MIME type.*/
/* *The MIME type indicates the image data is really a URL.*/
/* *The image is a JPEG.*/
/* *The image is a PNG.*/
/* *The image is a GIF.*/
/*@}*/
/* *The contents of a METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE tag.*/
/* *The picture type according to the ID3v2 APIC frame:

Others are reserved and should not be used.
There may only be one each of picture type 1 and 2 in a file.*/
/* *The MIME type of the picture, in printable ASCII characters 0x20-0x7E.
The MIME type may also be <code>"-->"</code> to signify that the data part
 is a URL pointing to the picture instead of the picture data itself.
In this case, a terminating NUL is appended to the URL string in #data,
 but #data_length is set to the length of the string excluding that
 terminating NUL.*/
