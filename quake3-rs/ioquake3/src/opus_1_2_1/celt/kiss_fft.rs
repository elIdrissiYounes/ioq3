 *  The return value from fft_alloc is a cfg buffer used internally

 *
 *  If lenmem is NULL, then opus_fft_alloc will allocate a cfg buffer using malloc.
 *  The returned value should be free()d when done to avoid memory leaks.

 *  The state can be placed in a user supplied buffer 'mem':
 *  If lenmem is not NULL and mem is not NULL and *lenmem is large enough,
 *      then the function places the cfg in mem and the size used in *lenmem
 *      and returns mem.
 *
 *  If lenmem is not NULL and ( mem is NULL or *lenmem is not large enough),
 *      then the function returns NULL and places the minimum cfg
 *      buffer size in *lenmem.
