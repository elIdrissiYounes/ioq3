    /*============================================================================
    **      On Intel Pentium processors (especially PIII and probably P4), converting
    **      from float to int is very slow. To meet the C specs, the code produced by
    **      most C compilers targeting Pentium needs to change the FPU rounding mode
    **      before the float to int conversion is performed.
    **
    **      Changing the FPU rounding mode causes the FPU pipeline to be flushed. It
    **      is this flushing of the pipeline which is so slow.
    **
    **      Fortunately the ISO C99 specifications define the functions lrint, lrintf,
    **      llrint and llrintf which fix this problem as a side effect.
    **
    **      On Unix-like systems, the configure process should have detected the
    **      presence of these functions. If they weren't found we have to replace them
    **      here with a standard C cast.
    */
    /*
    **      The C99 prototypes for lrint and lrintf are as follows:
    **
    **              long int lrintf (float x) ;
    **              long int lrint  (double x) ;
    */
    /*      The presence of the required functions are detected during the configure
    **      process and the values HAVE_LRINT and HAVE_LRINTF are set accordingly in
    **      the config.h file.
