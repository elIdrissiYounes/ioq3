/* * @defgroup opus_decoder Opus Decoder
 * @{
 *
 * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to decode Opus.
 *
 * The decoding process also starts with creating a decoder
 * state. This can be done with:
 * @code
 * int          error;
 * OpusDecoder *dec;
 * dec = opus_decoder_create(Fs, channels, &error);
 * @endcode
 * where
 * @li Fs is the sampling rate and must be 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000
 * @li channels is the number of channels (1 or 2)
 * @li error will hold the error code in case of failure (or #OPUS_OK on success)
 * @li the return value is a newly created decoder state to be used for decoding
 *
 * While opus_decoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
 * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
 * @code
 * int          size;
 * int          error;
 * OpusDecoder *dec;
 * size = opus_decoder_get_size(channels);
 * dec = malloc(size);
 * error = opus_decoder_init(dec, Fs, channels);
 * @endcode
 * where opus_decoder_get_size() returns the required size for the decoder state. Note that
 * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
 *
 * The decoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
 * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
 *
 * To decode a frame, opus_decode() or opus_decode_float() must be called with a packet of compressed audio data:
 * @code
 * frame_size = opus_decode(dec, packet, len, decoded, max_size, 0);
 * @endcode
 * where
 *
 * @li packet is the byte array containing the compressed data
 * @li len is the exact number of bytes contained in the packet
 * @li decoded is the decoded audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_decode_float())
 * @li max_size is the max duration of the frame in samples (per channel) that can fit into the decoded_frame array
 *
 * opus_decode() and opus_decode_float() return the number of samples (per channel) decoded from the packet.
 * If that value is negative, then an error has occurred. This can occur if the packet is corrupted or if the audio
 * buffer is too small to hold the decoded audio.
 *
 * Opus is a stateful codec with overlapping blocks and as a result Opus
 * packets are not coded independently of each other. Packets must be
 * passed into the decoder serially and in the correct order for a correct
 * decode. Lost packets can be replaced with loss concealment by calling
 * the decoder with a null pointer and zero length for the missing packet.
 *
 * A single codec state may only be accessed from a single thread at
 * a time and any required locking must be performed by the caller. Separate
 * streams must be decoded with separate decoder states and can be decoded
 * in parallel unless the library was compiled with NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK
 * defined.

 * data at the full sample rate, or knows the compressed data doesn't

 * framing overhead becomes negligible.
 *
 * The repacketizer currently only operates on elementary Opus
 * streams. It will not manipualte multistream packets successfully, except in
 * the degenerate case where they consist of data from a single stream.
 *
 * The repacketizing process starts with creating a repacketizer state, either
 * by calling opus_repacketizer_create() or by allocating the memory yourself,
 * e.g.,
 * @code
 * OpusRepacketizer *rp;
 * rp = (OpusRepacketizer*)malloc(opus_repacketizer_get_size());
 * if (rp != NULL)
 *     opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then the application should submit packets with opus_repacketizer_cat(),
 * extract new packets with opus_repacketizer_out() or
 * opus_repacketizer_out_range(), and then reset the state for the next set of
 * input packets via opus_repacketizer_init().
 *
 * For example, to split a sequence of packets into individual frames:
 * @code
 * unsigned char *data;
 * int len;
 * while (get_next_packet(&data, &len))
 * {
 *   unsigned char out[1276];
 *   opus_int32 out_len;
 *   int nb_frames;
 *   int err;
 *   int i;
 *   err = opus_repacketizer_cat(rp, data, len);
 *   if (err != OPUS_OK)
 *   {
 *     release_packet(data);
 *     return err;
 *   }
 *   nb_frames = opus_repacketizer_get_nb_frames(rp);
 *   for (i = 0; i < nb_frames; i++)
 *   {
 *     out_len = opus_repacketizer_out_range(rp, i, i+1, out, sizeof(out));
 *     if (out_len < 0)
 *     {
 *        release_packet(data);
 *        return (int)out_len;
 *     }
 *     output_next_packet(out, out_len);
 *   }
 *   opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
 *   release_packet(data);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, to combine a sequence of frames into packets that each
 * contain up to <code>TARGET_DURATION_MS</code> milliseconds of data:
 * @code
 * // The maximum number of packets with duration TARGET_DURATION_MS occurs
 * // when the frame size is 2.5 ms, for a total of (TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)
 * // packets.
 * unsigned char *data[(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)+1];
 * opus_int32 len[(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)+1];
 * int nb_packets;
 * unsigned char out[1277*(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/2)];
 * opus_int32 out_len;
 * int prev_toc;
 * nb_packets = 0;
 * while (get_next_packet(data+nb_packets, len+nb_packets))
 * {
 *   int nb_frames;
 *   int err;
 *   nb_frames = opus_packet_get_nb_frames(data[nb_packets], len[nb_packets]);
 *   if (nb_frames < 1)
 *   {
 *     release_packets(data, nb_packets+1);
 *     return nb_frames;
 *   }
 *   nb_frames += opus_repacketizer_get_nb_frames(rp);
 *   // If adding the next packet would exceed our target, or it has an
 *   // incompatible TOC sequence, output the packets we already have before
 *   // submitting it.
 *   // N.B., The nb_packets > 0 check ensures we've submitted at least one
 *   // packet since the last call to opus_repacketizer_init(). Otherwise a
 *   // single packet longer than TARGET_DURATION_MS would cause us to try to
 *   // output an (invalid) empty packet. It also ensures that prev_toc has
 *   // been set to a valid value. Additionally, len[nb_packets] > 0 is
 *   // guaranteed by the call to opus_packet_get_nb_frames() above, so the
 *   // reference to data[nb_packets][0] should be valid.
 *   if (nb_packets > 0 && (
 *       ((prev_toc & 0xFC) != (data[nb_packets][0] & 0xFC)) ||
 *       opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame(data[nb_packets], 48000)*nb_frames >
 *       TARGET_DURATION_MS*48))
 *   {
 *     out_len = opus_repacketizer_out(rp, out, sizeof(out));
 *     if (out_len < 0)
 *     {
 *        release_packets(data, nb_packets+1);
 *        return (int)out_len;
 *     }
 *     output_next_packet(out, out_len);
 *     opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
 *     release_packets(data, nb_packets);
 *     data[0] = data[nb_packets];
 *     len[0] = len[nb_packets];
 *     nb_packets = 0;
 *   }
 *   err = opus_repacketizer_cat(rp, data[nb_packets], len[nb_packets]);
 *   if (err != OPUS_OK)
 *   {

 *     return err;

 * An alternate way of merging packets is to simply call opus_repacketizer_cat()
 * unconditionally until it fails. At that point, the merged packet can be
