/*
 * Routines to process JPEG markers.
 *
 * Entry condition: JPEG marker itself has been read and its code saved
 *   in cinfo->unread_marker; input restart point is just after the marker.
 *
 * Exit: if return TRUE, have read and processed any parameters, and have
 *   updated the restart point to point after the parameters.
 *   If return FALSE, was forced to suspend before reaching end of
 *   marker parameters; restart point has not been moved.  Same routine
 *   will be called again after application supplies more input data.
 *
 * This approach to suspension assumes that all of a marker's parameters
 * can fit into a single input bufferload.  This should hold for "normal"
 * markers.  Some COM/APPn markers might have large parameter segments
 * that might not fit.  If we are simply dropping such a marker, we use
 * skip_input_data to get past it, and thereby put the problem on the
 * source manager's shoulders.  If we are saving the marker's contents
 * into memory, we use a slightly different convention: when forced to
 * suspend, the marker processor updates the restart point to the end of
 * what it's consumed (ie, the end of the buffer) before returning FALSE.
 * On resumption, cinfo->unread_marker still contains the marker code,
 * but the data source will point to the next chunk of marker data.
 * The marker processor must retain internal state to deal with this.
 *
 * Note that we don't bother to avoid duplicate trace messages if a
 * suspension occurs within marker parameters.  Other side effects
 * require more care.

 *
 * This implementation is substantially constrained by wanting to treat the
 * input as a data stream; this means we can't back up.  Therefore, we have
 * only the following actions to work with:
 *   1. Simply discard the marker and let the entropy decoder resume at next
 *      byte of file.
 *   2. Read forward until we find another marker, discarding intervening
 *      data.  (In theory we could look ahead within the current bufferload,
 *      without having to discard data if we don't find the desired marker.
 *      This idea is not implemented here, in part because it makes behavior
 *      dependent on buffer size and chance buffer-boundary positions.)
 *   3. Leave the marker unread (by failing to zero cinfo->unread_marker).
 *      This will cause the entropy decoder to process an empty data segment,
 *      inserting dummy zeroes, and then we will reprocess the marker.
 *
 * #2 is appropriate if we think the desired marker lies ahead, while #3 is
 * appropriate if the found marker is a future restart marker (indicating
 * that we have missed the desired restart marker, probably because it got
 * corrupted).
 * We apply #2 or #3 if the found marker is a restart marker no more than
 * two counts behind or ahead of the expected one.  We also apply #2 if the
 * found marker is not a legal JPEG marker code (it's certainly bogus data).
 * If the found marker is a restart marker more than 2 counts away, we do #1
 * (too much risk that the marker is erroneous; with luck we will be able to
 * resync at some future point).
 * For any valid non-restart JPEG marker, we apply #3.  This keeps us from
 * overrunning the end of a scan.  An implementation limited to single-scan
 * files might find it better to apply #2 for markers other than EOI, since
 * any other marker would have to be bogus data in that case.
