  MODEL TESTING

The viewthing and gun positioning tools from Q2 have been integrated and
enhanced into a single model testing facility.

Model viewing can begin with either "testmodel <modelname>" or "testgun <modelname>".

The names must be the full pathname after the basedir, like
"models/weapons/v_launch/tris.md3" or "players/male/tris.md3"

Testmodel will create a fake entity 100 units in front of the current view
position, directly facing the viewer.  It will remain immobile, so you can
move around it to view it from different angles.

Testgun will cause the model to follow the player around and suppress the real
view weapon model.  The default frame 0 of most guns is completely off screen,
so you will probably have to cycle a couple frames to see it.

"nextframe", "prevframe", "nextskin", and "prevskin" commands will change the
frame or skin of the testmodel.  These are bound to F5, F6, F7, and F8 in
q3default.cfg.

If a gun is being tested, the "gun_x", "gun_y", and "gun_z" variables will let
you adjust the positioning.

Note that none of the model testing features update while the game is paused, so
it may be convenient to test with deathmatch set to 1 so that bringing down the
console doesn't pause the game.
