     VM Considerations

     The VM can not use the standard system headers because we aren't really
     using the compiler they were meant for.  We use bg_lib.h which contains
     prototypes for the functions we define for our own use in bg_lib.c.

     When writing mods, please add needed headers HERE, do not start including
     stuff like <stdio.h> in the various .c files that make up each of the VMs
     since you will be including system headers files can will have issues.

     Remember, if you use a C library function that is not defined in bg_lib.c,
     you will have to add your own version for support in the VM.

/*
=============================================================================

LIGHT FLARES

A light flare is an effect that takes place inside the eye when bright light
sources are visible.  The size of the flare relative to the screen is nearly
constant, irrespective of distance, but the intensity should be proportional to the
projected area of the light source.

A surface that has been flagged as having a light flare will calculate the depth
buffer value that its midpoint should have when the surface is added.

After all opaque surfaces have been rendered, the depth buffer is read back for
each flare in view.  If the point has not been obscured by a closer surface, the
flare should be drawn.

Surfaces that have a repeated texture should never be flagged as flaring, because
there will only be a single flare added at the midpoint of the polygon.

To prevent abrupt popping, the intensity of the flare is interpolated up and
down as it changes visibility.  This involves scene to scene state, unlike almost
all other aspects of the renderer, and is complicated by the fact that a single
frame may have multiple scenes.

RB_RenderFlares() will be called once per view (twice in a mirrored scene, potentially
up to five or more times in a frame with 3D status bar icons).

RB_RenderFlares

Because flares are simulating an occular effect, they should be drawn after
everything (all views) in the entire frame has been drawn.

Because of the way portals use the depth buffer to mark off areas, the
needed information would be lost after each view, so we are forced to draw
flares after each view.

The resulting artifact is that flares in mirrors or portals don't dim properly
when occluded by something in the main view, and portal flares that should
extend past the portal edge will be overwritten.
