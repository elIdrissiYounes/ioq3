// The entire cgame module is unloaded and reloaded on each level change,

// time for fragments to sink into ground before going away
// amount to scale up the icons when activating
// num frame for '-' stats digit
// very large characters
//=================================================
// player entities need to track more information
// than any other type of entity.
// note that not every player entity is a client entity,
// because corpses after respawn are outside the normal
// client numbering range
// when changing animation, set animationTime to frameTime + lerping time
// The current lerp will finish out, then it will lerp to the new animation
// time when ->oldFrame was exactly on
// time when ->frame will be exactly on
// may include ANIM_TOGGLEBIT
// time when the first frame of the animation will be exact
// flip from 0 to 1
// machinegun spinning
//=================================================
// centity_t have a direct corespondence with gentity_t in the game, but
// only the entityState_t is directly communicated to the cgame
// from cg.frame
// from cg.nextFrame, if available
// true if next is valid to interpolate to
// true if cg.frame holds this entity
// move to playerEntity?
// so missile trails can handle dropped initial packets
// last time this entity was found in a snapshot
// decay the error from this time
// false if origin / angles is an interpolation
// exact interpolated position of entity on this frame

// gameplay
// true if using the new mission pack animations
// true if legs yaw is always the same as torso yaw
// true if torso never changes yaw
// move head in icon views
// from model
// each WP_* weapon enum has an associated weaponInfo_t
// that contains media references necessary to present the
// weapon and its effects
// the hands don't actually draw, they just position the weapon
// so it will rotate centered instead of by tag
// fast firing weapons randomly choose
// each IT_* item has an associated itemInfo_t
// that constains media references necessary to present the
// item and its effects
//======================================================================
// all cg.stepTime, cg.duckTime, cg.landTime, etc are set to cg.time when the action
// occurs, and they will have visible effects for #define STEP_TIME or whatever msec after
// incremented each frame
// taking a level menu screenshot
// don't defer players at initial startup
// don't play voice rewards, because game will end shortly
// there are only one or two snapshot_t that are relevant at a time

// the time from latestSnapshotNum, so we don't need to read the snapshot yet
