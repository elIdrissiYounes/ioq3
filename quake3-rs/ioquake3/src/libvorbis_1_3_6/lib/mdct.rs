function: normalized modified discrete cosine transform
          power of two length transform only [64 <= n ]

Original algorithm adapted long ago from _The use of multirate filter
banks for coding of high quality digital audio_, by T. Sporer,
K. Brandenburg and B. Edler, collection of the European Signal
Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Amsterdam, June 1992, Vol.1, pp
211-214

The below code implements an algorithm that no longer looks much like
that presented in the paper, but the basic structure remains if you
dig deep enough to see it.

This module DOES NOT INCLUDE code to generate/apply the window
function.  Everybody has their own weird favorite including me... I
happen to like the properties of y=sin(.5PI*sin^2(x)), but others may
vehemently disagree.

********************************************************************/
/* this can also be run as an integer transform by uncommenting a
define in mdct.h; the integerization is a first pass and although
it's likely stable for Vorbis, the dynamic range is constrained and
roundoff isn't done (so it's noisy).  Consider it functional, but
only a starting point.  There's no point on a machine with an FPU */
/* build lookups for trig functions; also pre-figure scaling and
some window function algebra. */
